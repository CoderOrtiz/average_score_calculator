# Average Score Calculator
Comparing scores from two separate teams using If Else Statements and Type Conversion's.

## Description:

My second coding challenge from, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022", was to make a calculator that took three different scores from two different teams, averaged the three scores from each team, and determined who had the higher score using If Else Statements. While this again was mainly review for me it did prove more challenging then I initially expected as the logic within the If Else Statements proved to be more complex than I anticipated. Instead of console.logging the results as requested, I made a little project out of it where the user could make two custom named teams and enter different values each calculation.

## What I changed:

I added a button titled "calculate" which provides the user a prompt requesting Team 1's name, Team 2's name, as well as their separate scores so the user can change the values easily.

## What I learned:

This was my first-time using Type Conversion. The scores entered by the user were converted from Strings to Numbers and plugged into an equation to average the scores. The instructor, Jonas, made a bonus challenge for his students by requesting not only make Logical Statements that determine who won with the average greater score, but to make a minimal score of 100 for a team to qualify. This proved more challenging that I expected but with playing with the syntax I was able to get the code to work as I visioned. I ran into bugs were some of the code would work and others wouldn‚Äôt, changes would be made and other lines of code wouldn‚Äôt work while others did. After some dedication and determination, I wrote the working Logic Statements to have all lines of code work as designed. I reviewed this challenge in December and struggled immensely and to for this challenge to come with the ease that it did was very rewarding.
